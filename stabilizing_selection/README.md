# Stabilizing Selection Model. 

## introduction 
In one of the earliest attempts to measure the natural selection, Bumpus (1899) measured the wing length of sparrows killed in a storm, and those that survived. He found that the survivors contianed and excess of birds with wings of average length, and a deficiency of birds with very long or very short wings. Many subsequent measurements of natural selection on quantitative traits have given the same picture: 
**Typical individuals do better than either extreme.** Such selection is referred to as **Normalizing** or **Stabilizing** selection.
